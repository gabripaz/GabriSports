                <h2>Lusail Iconic Stadium</h2>
                <p>Capacity: 80,000 seats | Opening: 2021 | Status: under construction</p>
                <img src="../img/Lusail-exterior.jpg" alt="Lusail Stadium" class = "floatleft">
                <p>Lusail Iconic Stadium or Lusail National Stadium (Arabic: ملعب لوسيل الدولي‎) is a stadium under construction in Lusail, Qatar. Scheduled to open in early 2022, the new facility will host the final of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
                    Construction officially began on 11 April 2017. Its final design was unveiled in December 2018.</p>
                <p>The stadium was designed by British firm Foster + Partners, who received support from MANICA Architecture specializing in sport design. In the construction phase, KEO Consultants provided design services to the Contractor as part of its Design & Build. KEO were replaced in 2018. The design includes an almost circular base and will be surrounded by a moat and be connected to the car park by six bridges.</p>
                <p>The stadium has a capacity of 80,000 seats. It has a near-circular footprint and sits on the masterplan's primary axis, which divides the stadium precinct into two halves. Encircled by a reflective pool of water, spectators cross the 'moat' to enter the building via six bridges. An outer pedestrian concourse extends from the water towards an array of smaller amenity buildings and a hotel at the stadium's perimeter. The British designers sought to mirror the ancient Arab craft of bowl weaving in the stadium's inner structure.</p>
                <img src="../img/Lusail-localiz.jpg" alt="Lusail localization" class = "floatright">
                <p>The saddle-form roof appears to float above the concrete seating bowl, discreetly supported by a ring of arching columns. Its central section can be retracted to allow the pitch to be either open to the sky or fully covered. The concave profile of the stadium's outer enclosure evokes the sails of a traditional dhow boat and incorporates a system of operable louvres. Inside, the seating bowl is designed to enhance the experience and atmosphere for spectators: VIP and hospitality accommodation is concentrated along the sides of the pitch to create a continuous sea of fans behind each goal.</p>
                <p>Located in the centre of a new development to the north of Doha, with direct connections by road and a new metro line, Lusail Iconic Stadium is intended to be a catalyst for development growth of Lusail city. Parking and service areas are shaded by canopies of solar collectors, which will produce energy for the stadium when it is in use, as well as generating power for neighbouring buildings.</p>               
                <p>The stadium was scheduled for completion in 2020 and will host three friendly matches until the 2022 World Cup.                    
                    Following the World Cup, it is expected to be reconfigured into a 40,000-seat stadium. Excess seating will be removed, and other parts of the building repurposed as a community space with shops, cafés, athletic and education facilities, and a health clinic.</p>

                <p>Al Bayt Stadium (Arabic: استاد البيت‎) is a football stadium in Al Khor, Qatar, intended to be used for matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The stadium's construction contract was awarded to Salini and Cimolai in 2015. In January 2020, the stadium received sustainability certificates of green design, construction management and energy efficiency.</p>
                <img src="../img/ALBaytlocal.png" alt="Al Bayt localization" class = "floatright">
                <p>The opening ceremony of the 2022 World Cup will take place at Al Bayt Stadium. FIFA and the Organizing Committee of the Qatar Supreme Committee have confirmed the start date as November 21 with an audience of 60,000. The architectural design takes its inspiration from the traditional tents of the nomadic peoples of Qatar and the region. It will take on an asymmetrical seashell motif, providing covered seating for all spectators. Connected to a number of transportation systems, the onsite parking will be able to hold 6,000 cars, 350 buses and the coming and going of 150 public buses/shuttles, as well as 1,000 taxis and water taxis. The stadium will host around 60,000 World Cup fans,[6] including 1,000 seats for press. The stadium is certified for its sustainability credentials under the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for a number of certifications representing sustainable design & build, construction management practices and the efficiency of its energy center. The stadium also received a five-star GSAS rating.</p>                
                <p>The stadium will also include luxurious hotel suites and rooms with balcony views of the football field.</p>                
                <p>To mark the National Sports Day, stadium's adjacent park's official opening was announced to be held on Qatar's sports day itself, 11 February 2020.</p>

                <img src="../img/AlJanoub.jpg" alt="" class = "floatleft">
                <p>Al-Janoub Stadium, formerly known as Al-Wakrah Stadium (Arabic: ملعب الجنوب‎), is a football stadium in Al-Wakrah, Qatar that was inaugurated on 16 May 2019. This is the second among the eight stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, after the renovation of Khalifa International Stadium. It was designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid together with the firm AECOM.</p>
                <img src="../img/AlJanoubtlocal.png" alt="Al Janoub Stadium localization" class = "floatright">
                <p>The stadium features a curvilinear postmodernist and neo-futurist design. The appearance of the roof was inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the Persian Gulf.</p>                
                <p>It will be the official seat of the football club Al-Wakrah SC, where matches for the Qatar Stars League will be held. The capacity of the stadium is 40,000, which is expected to reduce in half to 20,000 after the World Cup.</p>                
                <p>The stadium was designed by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, and her architectural firm, Zaha Hadid Architects. Zaha Hadid Architects stated that “The stadium was designed in conjunction with a new precinct so that it sits at the heart of an urban extension of the city, creating community-based activities in and around the stadium on non-event days.</p>
                <p>According to the designers, it was inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the Persian Gulf. The curvilinear roof and exterior references Al Wakrah's history of seafaring, additionally giving spectators the feeling on being on a ship. Bowed beams hold up the roof, resembling a ship's hull. The building is meant to resemble upturned dhow hulls arranged in a huddle to provide shade and shelter. The roof of the stadium is retractable, and is made from pleated PTFE fabric and cables, with the roof arches being 230 meters long.</p>
                <p>The cooling system prevents the stadium's users from overheating, due to Qatar's hot and arid climate. It is capable of cooling the spectator areas to 18°C and the field of play to 20°C. According to Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), "detailed micro-climate analysis informed the arena's shape, with aerodynamics and optimal shading from the roof, which incorporates a minimal amount of glass, making a significant contribution to temperature control."</p>

                <p>Khalifa International Stadium (Arabic: ملعب خليفة الدولي‎, romanized: Istād Khalīfah), also known as National Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Doha, Qatar, as part of the Doha Sports City complex, which also includes Aspire Academy, Hamad Aquatic Centre, and the Aspire Tower. It is named after Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar's former Emir. The final of 2011 AFC Asian Cup was held at this stadium. The stadium is also the first completed venue that will host a part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

                <p>The stadium opened in 1976. In 1992, the stadium hosted the games of the 11th Gulf Cup with its 15 games. Qatar finally came first and won the first golf cup. It was renovated and expanded in 2005, before the 2006 Asian Games, to increase its capacity from originally 20,000 to 40,000 seats. A roof covers the western side of the stadium. The eastern side has a large arch, which was used as a platform to launch fireworks from during the 2006 Asian Games opening ceremony.</p>

                <p>Before the 2005 renovation, the stadium was used mostly for association football (soccer) matches, but it is equipped for many other sports. Since 1997, the stadium has hosted the annual Doha Diamond League (previously known by other names) track and field competition. It is the Qatar national football team's home stadium. The stadium hosted 6 games of the 2011 Pan Arab Games: all matches of the Qatar national team in the group stage, as well as the quarterfinals, semi-finals and finals of the tournament.</p>                
                <p>After another redevelopment, the stadium reopened in May 2017.

                    On 17 December 2019, the stadium is scheduled as the venue of two 2019 FIFA Club World Cup matches: the fifth-place match and the semi-final between the CONMEBOL Libertadores champions and the winner of Match 3. Following the decision to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022, it was planned to increase the capacity of the stadium to 68,000.</p>

                <p>The construction of the new stadium was ongoing since the beginning of 2016.This is being done by the joint venture between Al-Balagh and Larsen & Toubro. After the World Cup the stadium will be reduced to 21,000 seats and become home to Al-Rayyan SC.</p>                
                <p>The inauguration of the stadium took place on 18 December 2020, which was Qatar's National Day, and exactly two years before the country hosts the 2022 FIFA World Cup final.[7] The stadium will also be one of two venues used for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
